# What

## Running at the camp side

The idea was born after the first rubyconf in NOLA 2011 - as continous attendees of railscamps and runners we'd thought to start the railsrunners program - from geeks for geeks. Run baby run!

## Run for Charity

We run for charity. Every host should define a charity and as a runner you should do a donation for it. Participating you will supporting something good.

## Run for you

Running is great exercise. And, let's face it - programmers aren't known for getting a lot of exercise. SO take this opportunity to get some! If you can't run 5k yet, it's a nice attainable distance if you start training now. We recommend the Couch-to-5k program.

## Run for fun

Running is a social activity. Get outdoors and spend some time with your fellow Rubyists doing something healthy and fun.

## Todo
