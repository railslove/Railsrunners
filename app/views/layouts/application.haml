      %h2 Running at the camp side
      %p.summary
        The idea was born after the first rubyconf in NOLA 2011 - as continous attendees of railscamps and runners we'd thought to start the railsrunners program - from geeks for geeks. Run baby run!

        Run for Charity
      %p.summary
        We run for charity. Every host should define a charity and as a runner you should do a donation for it. Participating you will supporting something good.
      %h2
        Run for you
      %p.summary
        Running is great exercise. And, let's face it - programmers aren't known for getting a lot of exercise. SO take this opportunity to get some! If you can't run 5k yet, it's a nice attainable distance if you start training now. We recommend the 
        %a(href="http://www.coolrunning.com/engine/2/2_3/181.shtml") Couch-to-5k program.
      %h2
        Run for fun
      %p.summary
        Running is a social activity. Get outdoors and spend some time with your fellow Rubyists doing something healthy and fun.
